# GroceryCo_CheckoutSystem
Checkout system created for the grocery store known only as GroceryCo

# Coding Exercise
## Overview
GroceryCo wants to develop a checkout system. Their pricing schemes are defined such as apples cost `75 cents` each three apples cost `$2.00`
Implement a checkout system which handles their pricing schemes.
## Details
Write a console program which takes as input an unsorted list of single items from a shopping cart and performs a `check-out`: printing an itemized receipt and total price.
Item prices can be defined in several ways.
An item may be priced individually.
For example, the 'Apple' item might cost 75 cents.
Item prices may also be based on quantity purchased.
For example, as a promotion, you may buy three `Apples` for `$2.00`.
Other promotions could be `buy one get one free” or “buy one, get one for 50% off`
The checkout should be able to accept items in any order and calculate the price appropriately.
For example, an Apple might be scanned, followed by 2 Oranges, and then an Apple again.
Prices and promotions often change at the last minute. Each time a checkout transaction begins, the system should accept a set of pricing rules for all items.
Note that there may be multiple pricing rules.
